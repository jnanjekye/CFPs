## Title 

Python up and running on kubernetes

## Duration

30 minutes

## Description 

Kubernetes is an opensource platform that features deployment, maintenance and scaling mechanisms that help us simplify the management of containerized python applications while giving you the portability, extensibility and self healing capabalities for your application. Whether you want to run a simple python application or a complex one, kubernetes can quickly and efficiently help you deploy and scale your applications, seamlessly roll out new features while limiting resources to only required resources.

This talk you will cover the basics on kubernetes, requirements of deploying a python application to kubernetes, a simple python application deployment to kubernetes and finally how to run a deep learning pipeline on kubernetes.

## Who and Why (Audience) 

This talk is for intermediate to advanced python developers but the concepts shall be explained in simplicity to even beginners. The audience should have the basics of running a python application.

At the end of this talk, you will be able to understand how to deploy a python application to kubernetes along with how to manage containers on kubernetes in the hope that you will try yourself.

## Outline 

+ Overview of kubernetes
+ Overview on containerization
  + What are conatiners and why do we need them.
  + Difference between containers and virtualization
  + Container management systems
+ Deploying a simple python application on kubernetes
+ Running a deep learning pipeline on kubernetes

## Additional notes 

I share my experience working on open source projects. I am authoring an article on the subject that will be published shortly on the Apress blog and another on opensource.com. From the blog on Apress, I was also requested to author a small book on python and kubernetes by the Apress acquisitions editor.

I am a regular speaker at both local (uganda, kenya) and international conferences. I give mostly technical talks on the python at conferences like PyconZA in south Africa among others. I have shared a link to some of my recorded talks on youtube
